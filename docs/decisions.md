# Decisions

Short records of decisions that shape the codebase. Add a new entry rather than editing an old one.

## 001 — Real Claude Code in a terminal, no Agent SDK (2026-10-05)

Sessions run the `claude` CLI in a PTY rendered by xterm.js. This keeps the exact terminal
experience (config, auth, slash commands, subscription billing) and avoids building a chat UI.
Structured status comes from Claude Code **hooks**, injected per session with
`claude --settings <generated file>`, which post events to the app. The user's `~/.claude` is
never modified.

## 002 — One project = one repo (2026-10-05)

Multi-folder projects complicate cwd, diffs and worktrees for little gain. `--add-dir` covers
the rare exception.

## 003 — Git integration for review, not a git client (2026-10-05)

In scope: branch and ahead/behind, changed files (including untracked), diff, stage / unstage /
discard, commit, push, worktree per session, create PR via `gh`. Out of scope: conflict
resolution, rebase, history graph, blame.

## 004 — Terminals do not outlive the app, for now (2026-10-05)

PTYs are owned by the app and killed on quit or renderer reload. Restoring Claude conversations
will use `claude --resume <session_id>` (id from the `SessionStart` hook). All spawning goes
through `TerminalBackend`, so a tmux-backed backend can be added if agents need to survive
restarts.

## 005 — Toolchain (2026-10-05)

electron-vite 5 (Vite 7), React 19, TypeScript 5.9 strict, zod 4 at IPC boundaries, Vitest,
Playwright for Electron E2E, ESLint flat config + Prettier. SQLite, Monaco and file watchers are
deferred until a feature needs them: start with JSON for metadata, git status driven by hook
events for change detection, and a lightweight diff viewer.

## Roadmap

1. **Now:** one terminal running Claude Code or a shell in a chosen folder. ✅
2. **MVP:** projects (repo, name, colour) in a sidebar; split-pane terminals per project;
   status from hooks (running / waiting / done / exited); git panel (branch, changes, diff,
   stage / commit / push).
3. **Next:** worktree sessions, resume on relaunch, "needs you" list + native notifications,
   create PR.
